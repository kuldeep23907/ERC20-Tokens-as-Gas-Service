# ERC20-Tokens-as-Gas-Service
ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2020 Final Project

## Problem

Once in a while everyone face this problem of having some ERC20 tokens in the wallet but no ETH to perform any action/transactions. To handle we usually have few options.

1. Buy some ETH via a centralised exchange - on the cost of KYC and losing psuedo-anonymity altogether?
2. Request your friend to send you some ETH - What if your friend is facing the same problem?
3. Oh a better way: Use any DEX and swap Token with ETH - well that requires ETH too and you have none!

So, what could be the solution for it?

## Solution

I am proposing a dapp which allows user to swap their token from well-renowned DEXs and user will pay the gas for this swapping in tokens only. The aim is let user have the desired ETH after this txn and he can use that ETH for interacting with any other DAPP in the world.
